## What is RaaS

With our RaaSâ„¢ API you can elegantly knit a sophisticated rewards program into your platform. Create an account, fund an account, manage catalog, send rewards, and get order history - all available on demand, real time, and as a service.


## System-wide Notes

* [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the only currently-supported content type for inputs or outputs. It is not required that the requests contain an Accept header, but if they do it should contain "application/json" or "*/*.
* All calls require the platform's authentication. Authentication uses [HTTP Basic auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with the platform name as the username and the platform access key as the password. These will be assigned by Tango Card.
* All dates will/must be represented in a format that is compatible with [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (for example: *2013-02-21T20:37:07-07:00*).
* Platform will be responsible for handling access to it's accounts (e.g. not allowing ACC1 to place an order using ACC2's account)... requests from authenticated platforms against their accounts will be implicitly trusted.
* Whenever money is concerned, it is in cents (e.g. $4 = 400).
* Fields in the RaaS API response objects may be added at any time. This means that whatever is used to demarshall the JSON responses into native data types needs to be able to handle unknown fields without failing.
* All responses may include a `system_message` field. This is a note from TangoCard to the platforms and not intended for end users. This will notify of things like planned outages and should be monitored.




# Resources



## Account Resources

The following is a section of resources related to the platform's accounts.

* An "account identifier" in the system can be whatever is convenient for the platform as long as it adheres to the following rules:
 * Between 5 and 96 characters in length (inclusive).
 * Must be made up exclusively of: alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscore (_), dash (-), or plus (+).
 * Must be unique to the platform.
* A "customer" is a mechanism for denoting a company, department, etc an account belongs to.
